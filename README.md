# Application-driven MRI

Matlab demo for the joint reconstruction-segmentation method from undersampled MRI data presented in MICCAI 2014;1:106-113 [[DOI]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10404-1_14). A 2D brain phantom is retrospectively undersampled and jointly reconstructed and segmented identifying four classes with a Gaussian mixture model. The accuracy of the segmentation relative to a fully sampled segmentation is compared with a separate method, where an intensity image is first fully reconstructed and then segmented.

_Note:_
The demo requires to download and install the packages KSVD-Box v13 and OMP-Box 10, which can be obtained from Ron Rubinstein's website.
